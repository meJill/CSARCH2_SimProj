THIS PROJECT IS CREATED BY CSARCH2 S12 STUDENTS
TOPIC: Cache memory (BSA/MRU)

Group 10:
    Abe, John Wesley
    Ferrer, Jemill Angelo
    Figueroa, Ezekiel Joachim
    Magsino, Gabriel Jaime

Task: 
    • Input: Block size, set size, MM memory size (accept both blocks and words), cache
    memory size (accept both blocks and words), program flow to be simulated (accept both
    blocks and words) and other parameters deemed needed (example: can simulate cache
    problem set # 4,5,6,7)

    • Output: number of cache hits, number of cache miss, miss penalty, average memory
    access time, total memory access time, snapshot of the cache memory. With option to
    output result in text file.

How to run:
    First make sure that you have node.js installed within your system, you can check this by going on cmd and typing node -v to check for version control
    With node.js installed open the folder in cmd and type npm install to check for updates on dependancy modules and then type node index to run the index file to start     the web app
   
    On a successful run the cmd should display "Server started on port 8000" and you can now open the web app on your default browser by going to the link:
    http://localhost:8000/

How to use:
    Input Main Memory, Cache Memory Size, Program Flow, Block Size and Set Size. Choosing if you want to calculate Blocks or Words
